# <span style="color:#1DB954">Spotify Collection Service</span>
### This tool collects my Spotify playlists into a collection.
I've provided a credentials template if you'd like to use this project for yourself. You will need to provide:
- Your Spotify App's Client ID
- Your Spotify App's Client Secret
- A redirect URL to which Spotify can send their token (I use my Github profile -- which is written into `main.py` to make it easier to pasting into the terminal)
- An array of playlist ID's to pull songs from
- A destination ID into which the service will output new songs
